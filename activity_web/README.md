# Activity Classification Web App

This adds a basic Flask backend and a browser frontend on top of the existing classroom activity classification pipeline.

## What it does

- Upload a classroom video from the browser
- Run the existing `StudentActivityPipeline`
- Return the generated JSON summary, CSV, and annotated video download links
- Show per-clip predictions in a table
- Enroll students from photos or videos using buffalo embeddings
- Mark attendance from a classroom photo with buffalo face detection and embedding matching
- Delete an enrolled student from the roster and remove their stored attendance rows

## Tabs

- `Activity Monitoring` runs the activity classification pipeline.
- `Attendance` lets you enroll students and mark attendance from a classroom photo.

## Run it

From the repo root:

```bash
source /Users/satyam/Desktop/classroom-ai-project/.venv/bin/activate
python -m activity_web.backend.app
```

Then open `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

## Notes

- The app reuses `ACTIVITY CLASSIFICATION PIPELINE/student_activity_pipeline.py` directly.
- Output files are written to `activity_web/runtime/`.
- Large videos can take a while because the pipeline performs full face detection and classification.
